        my name is vidhi yadav .During my pursuit of a B.Tech in Computer Science, I am wholeheartedly devoted to enhancing my skills in various web development technologies. My primary focus lies on mastering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which form the foundation of modern web applications,I have been engrossed in learning Java programming, which has opened up new possibilities for me in software development.
        However, my true passion lies in the captivating realms of machine learning and artificial intelligence.
        Besides programming and AI, I am also intrigued by the art of web designing and user experience. I am determined to master graphics, UI/UX design, and web development to create visually appealing and intuitive interfaces.
